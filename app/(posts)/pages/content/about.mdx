Hi, I'm **Harsh** — welcome to my little digital garden.

I'm a student who loves to explore the intersection of technology, learning, and creativity.

Currently, I'm building and writing at [**eightharsh**](https://eightharsh.com), where I share my thoughts, projects, and experiments.

Writing is one of my favorite things to do. I believe that **sharing is a form of learning**, and everyone deserves to grow through knowledge and experience — not just their own, but yours too.

### 📌 Future Goals

My long-term goal is to **build a tech company** that contributes meaningfully to advancing society — ideally something that simplifies access to knowledge, builds useful tools, or contributes to making the world more technologically advanced. I want to work on ideas that involve **AI, energy systems, software infrastructure, and education**. I'm also focused on **developing myself in math, physics, computer science, and programming** — foundational tools to think clearly and build responsibly.

### 🎯 Hobbies

- **Writing**: I love turning thoughts into text. It helps me reflect and refine my thinking.
- **Learning**: I'm always exploring new areas — from math and programming to physics and systems design.
- **Building Projects**: Whether it's a Python app, a web app in Next.js, or a learning experiment, I enjoy the process of making things from scratch.
- **Exploring Startups**: I’m inspired by the way small teams can change the world through ideas and code.

### 🧠 Role Models

- **Isaac Newton** — for his relentless pursuit of truth and foundational contributions to science.
- **Alan Turing** — for his pioneering work in computing and his belief in the power of ideas.
- I admire people who mix **deep thinking** with **real-world building**, and use **systems-level understanding** to improve human life.

### 📚 Favorite Books

- **The Beginning of Infinity** by David Deutsch — made me realize that knowledge is unbounded and progress is a fundamental part of the human story.
- **Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!** — fun, curious, and full of inspiration to live with curiosity and boldness.
- **Atomic Habits** — practical systems-thinking for life improvement.
- **Hackers & Painters** — helped shape how I view software as a creative craft.

### 🚀 Favorite Startups & Companies

- **Notion** — for its clean, flexible tools that help people think and organize.
- **Replit** — making programming accessible, fun, and multiplayer.
- **Vercel** — developer-focused and opinionated about good DX.
- **OpenAI** — for pushing the boundaries of what language models and AI can do to enhance human productivity and imagination.
- **SpaceX** — for its bold vision, engineering excellence, and relentless execution toward making humanity multiplanetary.

### 🤝 Volunteering

I've participated in **local student-led events**, helping with technical setups and guiding younger students in coding basics. I believe even small contributions can create a ripple effect in someone's learning journey. I hope to do more of this in the future — especially mentoring others who are just getting started in tech.
